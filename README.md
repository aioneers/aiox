# Our Motivation

At [**aioneers**](https://aioneers.com/), we place a lot of importance on giving back to our community.<br>
<br>
We operate in the field of supply chains, helping organizations close their supply chain performance gap whilst
retaining resilience and furthering sustainability. ([See our Manifesto](https://aioneers.com/about/why/)).<br>
<br>
We want a part of our work to be providing the supply chain data science community with open source,
free-to-use code for building applications. This will be accompanied by insightful explanations and tutorials,
so that data scientists across the world can achieve the same things we aim for; strengthened resilience, sustainability, and an optimized supply chain performance.<br>
<br>
We happily welcome contributions from anyone sharing the same goal, to build and spread better supply chain data science tools.<br>
<br>
We are dedicated to spending up to 5% of our time on sharing, exchanging and curating guides,
with the end goal of accelerating our community’s efforts to build a more sustainable world.

# Installation

Install the Python library from PyPI

```
$ pip install aiox
```

## Install and configure Azure CLI

For a lot of our functions we use the Azure CLI repository.

To install the current release, Azure CLI is necessary as a prerequisite: [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

On Windows, the installation guide can be found here: [Windows az CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli)

On macOS the Azure CLI can be installed with Homebrew on a command line: [macOS az CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos)

```
$ brew update && brew install azure-cli
```

On Linux, the Azure CLI can be installed via apt: [Linux az CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux)

```
$ curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

Then the Azure CLI needs to be signed, which is easiest with this command (for all systems):

```
$ az login
```
